# Hashtables

>In my side, hash is a confused data structure because you are added a linked list in the index of an array which have more than one elements, used to return the number more fast

## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->

* Actually is a new data Structure and new think and new way to solve
* you have an empty list have a size and needed to put the value in this array
* you have a key for the value and have a role to like key % size
* have many function like add to added a value in this array


## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->

Big-O(log(n))

## API
<!-- Description of each method publicly available in each of your hashtable -->

have a tow int params is value and the key of these value

have an add function to added the value in the array

have a contain to check if the key is available or not

have a get function to get the value of index

have a hash function to return the place of key for index size
