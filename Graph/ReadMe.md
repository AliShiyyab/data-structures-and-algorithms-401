# Graphs
<!-- Short summary or background information -->

>**Is a Non-Linear Data Structure that can be looked at as a collection of vertices.**

## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->

>**Implements Graph Calsses.**

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->

>The size, addNode, addEdge, getNeighbors are have a big-o(1) time (Without loop)

>getNode big-o(n) **used Loop**

>The size, addEdge, getNeighbors are have a big-o(1) **Space**

>addNode and getNode returned ArrayList thats mean the space is big-o(N)

## API
<!-- Description of each method publicly available in your Graph -->

>size: Returned the size of map

>addNode: Used to added a new node

>addEdge Used to added to node of String Type

>getNode: Used to return all nodes

>getNeighbor: This method return a list of all the Nodes that are connected to the Node we pass.
