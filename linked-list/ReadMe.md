## Challenge

**Challenge is not easy need to describe and analyze all thing before started solution and needed to search in other source to get a full details which are you need in this assignments.**

## Approach & Efficiency

>`isInclude and converToString` Function **Big-O (N)**

>`All Function in node Packages is Big-O(1)`

>`insert Big-O(1)`

## API
### Node Package:

>Using the constructore to get the data a value.

>Using the getter and setter for both next of Nodes type and value of integer type.

>`isInclude` Function, I used to search about the value i send from the main to the public function to check if the value is found or Not.: This descripe mean the returned value is *true* or *false*.

>`converTostring` Function, I used to print the value in string and i used the void function to *Printed*.

>`insert` Function i used to put the value using the setter function.

### In the main

>**I write some test and inserted value.**
